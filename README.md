# Kids-Cook-Project

Parents often struggle to get their children to eat fresh fruits and vegetables. Kids Cook is an interactive web app that parents can use to discover & track healthy, tasty and fun food options that their children will be more willing to try.

Users will answer a brief questionnaire about their child's current diet, allergies, likes and dislikes. Then the app will deliver balanced recipes in the scope of their child's likes and a visualization of the USDA food plate. The food plate visual will include a note about which particular part of the plate may need focus in order to ensure a solid foundation for healthy nutrition.
